Vimball Install
===============

This code installs vimballs, it is nothing more than a small script that you install by typing in:

    sudo make install

If you want to remove the script then merely:

    sudo make uninstall

You can contact me at robertmasssaioli@gmail.NOJUNKMAIL.com. Where you remove the no junk mail text.
